## 👨🏻‍💻 A little bit about me

Hi there 👋🏻  
I'm José Luís Rodrigues, graduated in Computer Systems Engineering at [IPCA](https://ipca.pt/en/). Currently I'm working as a Frontend Developer at a portuguese consulting company called Bee Engineering and the client that I'm allocated is from Kuwait(can't give more details, sorry).

If you are interested in contacting me, please do not hesitate. You have my linkedin and email down below.
