## 👨🏻‍💻 A little bit about me

Hi there 👋🏻  
- I'm a software developer with experience working with frontend development(mostly with React) and some experience with backend(using NodeJs).
- I'm always ready for a challenge, and looking for stuff to do.
- Even though I have more experience with frontend development I have a special taste for backend and mobile development.

If you are interested in contacting me, please do not hesitate. You have my linkedin and email down below.

## Studies
Currently I'm studying more about frontend development with ReactJS and backend with NodeJS
